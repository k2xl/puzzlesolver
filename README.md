Puzzle Solver
This JavaScript program attempts to find solutions for puzzles that involve 2D blocks on a board
where the rows and columns of the board can not contain the same shape twice.
The technique is a simple recursive function to find solutions (breadth first search).
The algorithm could possibly be improved to prevent mirrored attempts from being attempted again
